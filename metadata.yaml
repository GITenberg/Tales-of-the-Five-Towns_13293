description: 'Published in 1905, Tales of the Five Towns collects a dozen stories,
  divided into two sections: " At Home " and " Abroad ." The eight " At Home " tales
  take place in Bennett''s beloved Five Towns, a location based on the Potteries district
  of Staffordshire, where he spent his early years. " Abroad " contains four stories
  which, though taking place in London, still have characters connected with the Potteries.
  All of the tales depict the industrial and social conditions of Victorian England,
  often with sympathy and humor.'
